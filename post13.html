            <p>In January 2018, <a href="https://techintersections.org/" target="_blank">Tech Intersections</a> had its inaugural conference! It was powerful to  go to a conference and not feel othered, to feel like I belonged. There were so many amazing women and non-binary folks!
            The opening speaker, Ericka Joy, spoke about about the Lies of Silicon Valley, which was an AMAZING talk (if you don't know about her I recommend looking her up). </p>

            The Workshops I attended:
            <ul><li>Write Your Power
            <li>Early Career Skills
            <li>Self Care Workshop
            </ul>

            <p>There were so many great talks to choose from, I was so sad I couldn't be at all of them at once!
            I choose to do “Write your Power” since I have been working on my website, blog post, cover letters and resumes so it felt like the best fit. And I am glad I did, I already see an improvement.</p>

            <p>The second workshop I did was Early Career Skills. It was a panel of women that discussed topics from: handling performance reviews, to advocating for yourself for your needs (and if you have any disabilities) and the pitfalls: getting fired, getting pushed out of a job, navigating white spaces, ect.</p>

            <p>The last workshop I did was Self Care, this was a two hour workshop, and I was happy I chose it.  With all the things I am trying to get done, I know I need to take some time to take care of myself, and I need to do a better job of integrating this daily. We spent time discussing our values and wants and needs. We had a great group discussion about what issues we have been encountering and got to hear how other people were handling it.</p>

            <p>The closing speaker was Leah McGowen-Hare, she was PHENOMENAL! She discussed her pathway in tech including the positive and negatives. She left us thinking about the four C’s: Connection, Celebration, Conviction, and Collaboration; look out for another blog post discussing how I use the 4C’s in my life.</p>

            <img src="img/13-4.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="" width="400" height="auto">

            <p>All in all, it was beyond amazing to walk into a space and be your authentic self and feel the sense of community. I can’t wait to attend next year!</p>

            <!-- <p><b>Data Literacy</b>
            <br>People that are not data literate don't know to question the data being presented or know that the data does not paint a complete picture.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Sinyangwe" target="_blank"> Samuel Sinyangewe</a> gave a great example of how data can be presented and used to further an agenda:
              <ul>
                <li>In his studies he has found that 'Black folks are 3x more likely to be killed by police.'</li>
                <li>Washington post database says 'Black folks are 1/4 killed by police and White folks are 2/4 people killed by police' and this is true, <b>but</b> this does not account for population.</li></p>
              </ul>
            <p>This is just one example, so you can imagine the issues that can and will arise as we continue to use data. The people working with data aren't always aware of the social implications that come with their work and it may become easier and easier for them to forget that the data is not just data,<i> those numbers can represent human lives</i>. We must hold society accountable when data is being used. There needs to be transparency with the process: from collection to how it is presented.</p> -->
