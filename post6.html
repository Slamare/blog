            Just completed my first DataDive...it definitely was a great learning experience!

            <p>
              <b>Process:</b>  The Data Dive was from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon.</b> 
              <ul>
              <li>Friday evening we got to hear presentations from the three non-profits and learn what they were hoping to accomplish with the data. I chose to work with <a href="https://www.concrn.org/" target="_blank"> Concrn </a> they are a non-profit that is an alternative to 911 and they are located in the Tenderloin of SF (they do have another location). They have a phone app that you can use to report an issue and let them know about someone in distress. They dispatch receives the message and sends someone to the location. I think this is a great mission and so I decide to join the team. 
              <li>Saturday we had a team meeting and then we then broke up the tasks and formed even smaller teams. I worked with one other person and our goal was to make charts that they could use to find areas of improvement for their dispatch team. 
              <li>Sunday we finished the last touches of our projects and prepped for the presentation. 
            </ul>
          </p>

            <p>
              <b>Presentation/Prototype:</b>
              We weren't allowed to showcase any of the data and presentation materials because it is owned by the non-profit and had confidential information. So I'll give a synospis of what we did. We used ggplot to make a chart of the months and time of day with frequency of responses;
              the purpose of this was to show the peak times and give Concrn a better idea of when they should ensure they have more staff on-call.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>The Challenges:</b>
              We had some difficulties with programming, but that is normal. They even had tutors/mentors there for us to ask questions when we were stuck! There weren't any issues, it was a welcoming environment and extremely organized. 
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>What I learned:</b>
              It was not as intimidating as I thought it would be, everyone was really nice and helpful. And I got to use R and shiny, which was cool since I haven't used R since college.
              I learned a ton about the data science process and other tools to use for learning R. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What's happen's next:</b>
              I will definitely attend future Data Dives, its a great way to network and meet others in the Data Science field!
